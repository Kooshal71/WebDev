      <!-- 
        * is know as the universal selector
        it contains all the text that is present withiin it
        , can be used to change multiple selectors
      -->
      <h2>This is amazing</h2>
      <!-- 
        id selector
        We can use ids on any element to provide a hook
        to the element so that CSS can be applied on it
        the id should not repeat, therefore it can be used only once
        id should not start with numbers or have any spaces
        They should be used to a minimum
        Syntax:-
        #id{
          property:value;
        }
      -->
      <!-- 
        class selectors
        We can use classes on groups of elements this allows
        us to change all the elements have the same class to be
        modified at once
        Syntax:-
        .class{
          property:value;
        }
      -->
      <!-- 
          descendent selectors
          selects elements that are present within other elements
          this will style only the internal elements having the mentioned
          external elements
          Syntax:-
          external internal{
            property:value;
          }
          li a{
            color: purple;
          }
        -->
      <!-- 
        adjacent selector
        They select only the elements that are immediatly
        followed by the next element
        Syntax:-
        element1 + element2{
          property:value;
        }
        h1 + p{
          property:value;
        }
        This will select the paragraph right after h1
      -->
      <!-- 
        direct child
        selects the elements which are the direct child 
        of the parent element
        Syntax:-
        parent > child{
          property:value;
        }
        footer > a{
          color:green;
        }
      -->
      <!-- 
        Attribute selector
        Select all elements having a particular type
        Syntax:-
        element[attribute=""]{
          property:value;
        }
        input[type="text"]{
          color:red;
        }
        -->
      <!-- 
        pseudo classes
        keywords added to a selector that specifies a
        speacial state of the element
        Syntax:-
        element:class{
          property:value;
        }
        a:hover{
          color:red;
        }
      -->
      <!--
        pseudo elements
        Keywords added to a selector that specifies a 
        particular part of the element
        Syntax:-
        element::part{
          property:value;
        }
        h2::first-letter{
          font-size: 50px;
        }
      -->
      <!-- 
        Cascading
        The order of declaration matter whichever is declared
        later will have a higher priority
        element{
          property:value1;
        }
        element{
          property:value2;
        }
        value2 will be applied to the property of the element
        If more than one stylesheet is linked in the HTML
        file then the order in which the files are linked will also
        change the behaviour of the webpage.
      -->
      <!--
        Specificity
        Rules followed when there is a conflict in styling
        the same element.
        There is a measure of how specific a given selector
        is to find out which is more important
        id > class > element
        If there is a tie in the specificity score then whichever
        comes later will be applied
      -->
      <!--
        Inline Styles are the most specific and are used
        directly in the HTML code and whatever change is present
        in the stylesheet will not change the style of the element
      -->
      <!--
        !important is an attribute used in CSS to give
        highest specific and it will be used irespective of
        position or specificity
        Not a good practice
