Numbers
    In JS we can store all types of numbers(float, int, negative and positive)
    NaN - is a concept that represents something that is Not a Number
    0/0 is an example of Not a Number.

    Variables
    They give names or labels to values so that they can be used later on
    let allows us to declare the variable
    let name = value;
    let year = 2002;

    const is a keyword that is also very similar to let except that we cannot 
    change the value later on in the program
    const pi = 3.14

    var is the old way of making variables previously this was the only method to create new
    variables, there isn't anything special to this and no actual reason to use them.

Booleans
    They can be used to store just 2 values (true and false)
    0 is another way to represent false

Variables can change type in JS

Variable naming
    cannot start with numbers
    cannot have spaces in them
    they are case-sensitive
    they can contain special characters
    camel case is very common naming convention
