/*
Strings
    They are a primitive type which can hold words
    All characters are allowed inside the string
    Single and Double quotes are both allowed 
    opening and closing quotes must be the same
    They have indices for easier access
    Ex - CHICKEN
    K has an index of 4
    We cannot change a single character a time manually
    We need to update the entire string 
    string + int will give a string
String Methods
    length is a property
    when using methods
    string.method()
    this is like a function
    toUpperCase()
    toLowerCase()
    Trim() - used to remove the whitespace to the left and right of string
    we cam also chain methods together in JS 
    many of the methods accept arguments
    indexOf(char) - gives the first occurrence of the passed value
        returns -1 if character is not found
    slice(start, stop) - similar to slicing in python
        we can give negative indices for slice method
    replace(original, new) - replaces the original string with the new string
Template Literals
    Strings that allow embedded expressions
    We need to use back ticks ` to use these strings
    We can use a $with {} to contain the expression 
NULL
    Intentional absence of any value
Undefined
    Variables which have not been assigned are undefined
Math Object
    It is a library that gives us a collection of constants and functions
    Math.random() - gives us a random number from (0,1)
    Math.floor(Math.random()*x)+1
    x - is the required range
